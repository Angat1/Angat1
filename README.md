### 🧠 Current Focus

- Building a **lightweight LLM** (~10–15GB RAM) from scratch to understand and replicate transformer architecture at a foundational level.
- Scaling **open-source financial datasets** for NEPSE and beyond.
- Enhancing cognitive diagnostics and AI adaptation inside **CognifyNow**.
- Scaling **SocrateAI’s** reach through live instruction and Nepal-first curriculum.

### 🌍 Vision
